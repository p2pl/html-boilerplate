Educational JavaScript Boilerplate

This project includes a modular and beginner-friendly script.js boilerplate to help kickstart your JavaScript interactivity layer.

## ✅ Features:

- DOMContentLoaded wrapper to ensure scripts run only after the DOM is fully loaded

- Utility functions ($ and $all) for simplified element selection

- Accessible mobile menu toggle example (#menu-button & #main-nav)

- Dark mode toggle example (#toggle-theme)

- Basic error handling pattern with try/catch

- Commented for learning and customization

- // Example: Toggle dark mode
   const themeBtn = $("#toggle-theme");
   if (themeBtn) {
   themeBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
   document.body.classList.toggle("dark");
   });
   }
Use this as a foundation and extend it with your own modules, logic, or components.

## ✅ Features

- Valid and semantic HTML5 structure
- SEO-optimized meta tags
- Open Graph (OG) + Twitter Cards for social sharing
- JSON-LD structured data (Schema.org)
