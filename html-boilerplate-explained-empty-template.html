    <meta property="og:locale" content="en_US">
    <!-- Declares the default language and region of your content. It tells platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Discord, WhatsApp, etc. which language and regional format your page is written in.

    <meta property="og:locale:alternate" content="pl_PL">
    <!--Lists other languages/regions your content supports. This is an optional tag that tells platforms: “This page is also available in Polish.”
    Include only if you actually support those languages via alternate pages or translations.-->
    <!--Bonus: If you support multiple languages, you should also include hreflang tags for SEO:
        <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://yourdomain.com/" />
        <link rel="alternate" hreflang="es" href="https://yourdomain.com/es/" />
        <link rel="alternate" hreflang="fr" href="https://yourdomain.com/fr/" />
        These go in the <head> too — and help Google serve the correct version of your site in search results based on the user's language preference.-->
